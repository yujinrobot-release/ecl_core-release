%description
Provides a signal/slot mechanism (in the same vein as qt sigslots,
boost::signals etc for intra-process communication. These include some
improvements - they do not need a preprocessor, are fully type safe, allow for
simple connections via a posix style string identifier and are multithread-safe.

# In case we're installing to a non-standard location, look for a setup.sh
# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
